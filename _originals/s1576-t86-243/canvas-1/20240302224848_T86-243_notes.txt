2729.474895	2729.474895	My name is Zora Neal Hurston. I was born in Eatonville, FLorida. I'm 35 years old. This song that I'm going to sing is a railroad song that I found on a railroad gang near Miami and was song to me by Max Ford.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
2749.352767	2749.352767	How long ago was that?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
2751.045425	2751.045425	That was in 1930.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
2755.428973	2755.428973	How did you happen to be going around getting songs?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
2757.859455	2757.859455	I was collecting folk material for Columbia University as part of the Barnard College, Columbia University.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
2765.41131	2765.41131	What is the song called?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
2766.756756	2766.756756	They call it Gonna see my long-haired babe and it's a railroad spiking song and the rhythm is kept with a spike and a hammer.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
2776.912699	2776.912699	Will you try to emphasize, give me the approximate rhythm of the hammer with the stick by hitting it against that?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
2782.207678	2782.207678	Yes, sir.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
2883.072689	2883.072689	Let them hammers ring, boy.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
2887.933653	2887.933653	I see you, you seem to be hitting down twice for a hammer. Why is that?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
2894.357071	2894.357071	Uh, the men face each other with hammers and they call on each other; they're breasted, they stand breast to breast and one comes down and the other one comes down.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
2902.950561	2902.950561	Immediately afterwards?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
2903.688386	2903.688386	Yes, one comes down [strike, strike]	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
2906.596284	2906.596284	I see [strike, strike] and how long is that between the double strikes?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
2912.325278	2912.325278	The minute that one goes down, the other is on the upstroke and comes right down behind it.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
2916.318213	2916.318213	And who does the singing?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
2917.70706	2917.70706	They sing in line. It's a man who doesn't work at all. And he walks up and down and gives the rhythm for the people to work.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
2925.258916	2925.258916	Is this for a whole crew of men?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
2926.908171	2926.908171	A whole crew of men singing this one time and the railroad has to pay the singing liner or else the men won't work.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
2934.763837	2934.763837	What I'm asking you is if you hear that you only hear the one man singing on a whole section of track.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
2940.536232	2940.536232	Not all the time, because different ones have verses they want to put in themselves and so they jump in and after they start the song but the singing liner always starts it.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
2948.825912	2948.825912	Well now look, uh, the only thing is that you were giving a long piece of singing without the rhythm of the hammer and I want to know approximately how often that comes.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
2958.374235	2958.374235	Well, they often do that and then after that they [distortion] get in there but they [distortion]	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
2973.60815	2973.60815	[inaudible]	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
2977.297275	2977.297275	Uh, this song I got in Callahan, Florida, which is a railroad center in the northern part of Florida.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
2986.107773	2986.107773	Inaudible.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
2988.104241	2988.104241	I got this in 1935. I don't remember the man's name who sung it to me but I got it at Callahan. It's a railroad camp.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
2996.95814	2996.95814	What kind of song is it?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
2998.43379	2998.43379	This is not exactly a song. It's a chant for the men lining. You know a railroad rail weighs 900 pounds and the men have to take these lining bars and get it in shape to spike it down. And while they're doing that why they have a chant that, uh, and also some songs that they be used to, the rhythm to work it into place and then the boss hollers 'Bring 'em a hammer gang' and they start to spike it down. And this is a chant for lining the rail.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
3050.949566	3050.949566	I'd like you to do that again. But this time, when they have . . . What do they call the irons they use?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
3055.636924	3055.636924	They call it a lining bar.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
3056.852165	3056.852165	Alright. The lining bar. When they work but don't you hear the clink of it?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
3061.71313	3061.71313	It's a 'hah'! Now you don't hear the lining bar because it's under the rail and they shove the rail with it.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
3067.962941	3067.962941	They hit against it?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
3068.483759	3068.483759	No, it's under it. You see, it's just like on this. It's a crow bar.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
3072.737102	3072.737102	Because over in Mississippi, they showed me by hitting the thing. They said that the way that they did it was by several men taking a short hit.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
3081.460797	3081.460797	Well, I've seen them put it between their legs this way and put it back and they get this, this splange under the rail, and then they 'heh, heh'. You know, like that.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
3090.455752	3090.455752	Well, now what do they do? Are they pulling it, pulling it --	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
3092.669226	3092.669226	Pulling it backwards, they're moving it backwards.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
3093.97127	3093.97127	In other words, they have it underneath and they're using the lever to go forward.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
3097.562742	3097.562742	That's right. Yes.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
3099.211998	3099.211998	Alright.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
3100.101728	3100.101728	And all the men, you know because it's always straining and they 'heh'.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
3102.619013	3102.619013	About how many are there on a bar?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
3103.921057	3103.921057	Oh, some time it's about 7 or 8 on at one time.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
3108.716919	3108.716919	Hmhm. Well, I suppose you try it and you sing it over again.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
3112	3112	Alright	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
3113	3113	Or chant it.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
3142.960181	3142.960181	I got 'That Old Black Gal' is a spiking song that I got down there in Miami and was song by Max Ford the singing liner on this construction crew.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
3153.084082	3153.084082	What's it used for?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
3154.291519	3154.291519	Used for spiking down the rails.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
3230.73161	3230.73161	This song they called 'Shove it Over' and it's the lining rhythm pretty generally distributed all over Florida. It was sung to me by Charlie Jones on a railroad construction camp in Lakeland, Florida.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
3243.734785	3243.734785	About how long ago?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
3245.081542	3245.081542	Uh, I gathered that in '33, 1933.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
3360.391837	3360.391837	This is again for lining?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
3362.063673	3362.992472	This is a lining rhythm.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
3362.992472	3365.546667	Now where is the movement?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
3365.500227	3371.351655	When they say Shacka-lacka-lacka like they are getting ready to pull back and when they say 'heh' they shove the rail over.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
3371.351655	3375.113288	In other words, this song gives them quite a lot of rest in between.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
3375.066848	3376.599365	Right a lot of rest in between.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
3376.552925	3377.342404	And a harder shove?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
3377.295964	3380.128798	And a harder shove at the end. And they say 'heh', they all go.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
3380.175238	3385.562268	It seems to have had a different effect from the other lining one you gave, I mean that one about Mobile.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
3385.469388	3395.639728	Yes, but someone was short and someone only just come to the mood of the liner. And the men work whatever song he sung, they work that rhythm.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
3395.686168	3438.503764	Uh, now when the men are lining, they put the rail down, and then of course the captain, he's crouched straddle of it and uh, looks down it so he can tell when it's lined up in exact line with the others. And if they carry it, well he'll say shove it over and if they carry it too far, he'll say send it back and when they get it exactly in line, he'll tell em 'join it ahead' but then they corrupted that to 'join ahead' and all of them say 'join ahead' for 'join it ahead'. And, uh, so, uh, this song is about a lining and the rhythm goes with, they put this lining bar, this long steel bar, crow bar, between their legs so they have greater purchase and pull back on it.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
3438.503764	3441.615238	Well, wait a minute. They pull back . . . and how are they facing in relation to the rail.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
3441.568798	3444.448073	Their back is to the rail.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
3444.448073	3447.327347	In other words, they're pulling up on the bar.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
3447.327347	3452.110658	They're pulling up on the bar. They don't have to look at the rail because that's the captain's job to see when it's right.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
3452.157098	3455.640091	Well, what do they do? Do they, how do they get it under the bar, the rail?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
3455.686531	3460.376961	They just push the flange of this lining bar under the rail and then pull back on it.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
3460.330522	3462.977596	Do they have to look back at it or do they just feel it?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
3462.931156	3469.757823	Oh, they can just feel it. Sometimes they look back, you know, but most of them, they just can feel it and they send it back on there.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
3469.711383	3479.974603	Well, uh, you were saying, you were explaining that there's different rhythms that they have. Are there any particular times when a faster on or a slower one would be used?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
3479.928163	3507.513469	Well, it's different; it's not any particular time except just the feeling of the singing liner. Whatever song he starts. If it's a fast rhythm they work fast; if its's a slow one, well they work, you know, a little slower but they get just as much work done, it seems, somehow or another.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
3507.513469	3510.346304	ZNH singing low.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
3510.392744	3511.321542	Alright.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
3511.321542	3530.176145	Alright, this song I'm going to sing is a lining rhythm and I'm going to call it Mule on the Mount though you can start with any verse you want and give it a name and it's the most widely distributed work song in the United States and it has innumerable verses and whatnot about everything under the sun and it's a lining rhythm though they sometimes sing it just [cut off].
