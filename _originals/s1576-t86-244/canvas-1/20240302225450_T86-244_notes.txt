0	11.079545	 In the jook houses and doing any kind of work at all, chopping wood and in the lumber camps and everywhere you find this song. No where you can't find parts of this song, 'Mule on the Mount'.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
11.079545	15.805785	Well, is it known, is it a consistent song as you hear it all over?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
16.270661	24.405992	The tune is consistent but the verses, you know how things, in every locality you can find some new verses, everywhere.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
23.863636	23.863636	I mean does it have the same choral verses? Does it have 'Mule on the Mount' wherever you hear it?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
27.892562	33.703512	Well, there's some place that I haven't heard that same verse 'Mule on the Mount' but there's no place that I don't hear some of the same verses.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
34.788223	38.119835	Where did you learn it this particular way?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
38.119835	43.272211	Well, I heard the first verses, I got it in my native village of Eatonville, Florida from George Thomas.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
45.829029	47.572314	And this is one version you're going to sing?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
47.649793	52.76343	I'm going to sing, oh I guess, all the tune is the same. I'm going to sing verses from a whole lots of places.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
52.76343	53.267045	Alright.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
218.570509	226.239669	When you hear that sung, or nearly sung, about how many verses does a man know? He doesn't know as many as you do.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
226.239669	229.145145	Yes, sometimes they sing 30 and 40 verses.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
229.300103	230.772211	Is one of these continuous?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
230.772211	235.266012	It's one of these things that's grown by incremental repetition until perhaps it's the longest song in America.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
236.893079	236.893079	[inaudible]	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
238.287707	238.287707	Zora Neale Hurston laughs [distortion]	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
247.159091	248.360021	What's your name, please?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
248.360021	249.677169	Beatrice Lange.	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
250.258264	251.420455	Where do you come from?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
252.272727	254.713326	I came from South Georgia.	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
255.333161	256.61157	Where? What part of South Georgia?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
256.68905	257.425103	Woodbine.	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
257.85124	258.897211	And how old are you?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
259.207128	259.943182	35	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
260.21436	262.383781	And what are you going to tell us or?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
262.383781	266.761364	Well, I'm going to tell some folk stories that my brother-in-law told me.	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
267.536157	268.233471	How long ago?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
268.620868	270.247934	About a year ago.	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
270.015496	271.448864	A short, a short while back.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
271.410124	274.625517	Well, it happened longer than that but he told me about a year ago.	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
274.780475	277.376033	I mean, how did it, it happened long ago . . . what do you mean by that?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
277.376033	280.475207	I mean that the story happened longer than that.	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
280.475207	282.141012	Well, how did it go? I mean how did it --	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
282.141012	286.867252	Well, this old negro of his told him about it. The negro belonged to his father.	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
287.332128	287.874483	Uh-huh	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
287.874483	289.114153	Who had a rice plantation.	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
290.121384	293.143079	The negro told it to him when? I mean did he ever tell you that?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
293.143079	296.203512	About six months to a year ago.	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
296.784607	298.954029	I mean the negro had just told him the story?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
298.566632	300.929752	Yes, while he was working with him.	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
300.929752	306.895661	I see. And you don't have any name for it? Is that right?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
307.05062	310.653409	Well, uh, it's a storm story, a hurricane story.	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
311.079545	312.629132	Just, okay, [laughing] go ahead .	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
312.629132	315.689566	I have several stories though. This is just one.	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
315.689566	318.440083	Well, let's start off with just one. That's the easiest way.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
318.440083	319.098657	Alright, sir.	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
319.098657	322.120351	Alright. Well, can you tell it or are you going to tell it or read it?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
322.31405	323.786157	Well I can kind of glance at it.	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
324.251033	325.878099	Alright. Go ahead.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
326.652893	333.626033	Uh, this story happened during the fall of 1898 upon a small island off of the coast of Georgia	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
334.207128	343.155992	Where the sea level was very low. Came a hurricane which covered the whole island in several feet of water and most of the natives had to swim around in their homes.	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
343.543388	350.40031	One particular instance which calls to mind is that of an old negrum owned by one of the early rice planters.	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
351.252583	362.332128	He tells: Yes sir, we were swimming around in that water trying to find a shallow place when we seen some of them pretty long neck bottles floating around. Look like them water in 'em.	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
362.874483	376.510847	So we drink some and before long we was glad to have some been come because it sure made us feel good. Sure wish I could have some of that stuff now. Boss, I believe that been shampoo.	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
377.556818	382.166839	Further on the flooded plantation, the boss paddled his canoe up to the loft of the barn.	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
382.554236	401.497934	There sat another of his n-- with a big stick in his hand as if he was going to strike something. Even that the hole in the side of the barn where the [inaudible] was stored had looked as if a board had been torn off. He glanced over in the corner and there'n a pile of dead coons which looked like a hundred or so.	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
401.497934	433.57438	As the boss approached, he said, 'By grade, Tom, what have you been doing here?' He replied in a dramatic voice, 'Boss, I's just been praying all the time, how's that good for the ole master to come take this water back where it belong so we's could get back to work. Boss, I've been a praying every chance that I'm got to liberation.' 'Well, from the looks of the coons you killed, you didn't have time to pray much, Tom'. 'Mass Donald,  I wouldn't have killed 'em but they kept barring me from praying all the time.'	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
433.57438	446.126033	Another story I told of an old native of Georgia came to Florida in the nineties to seek adventure. This old cracker who really lived in the backwoods had a name of being the biggest liar in the country.	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
446.43595	452.634298	Now look, suppose you don't read it from there and you just tell me it as a story. Go ahead. You can do it.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
451.007231	452.169421	Just let me glance at it.	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
452.169421	452.866736	Alright. Go ahead.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
452.866736	453.951446	[Laughter]	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
455.113636	455.733471	Go ahead.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
456.198347	467.58781	He said me and my son Israel, we went down to Floridy to pick oranges. Huh. They grow so big you can fill a water bucket full with four of 'em.	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
468.285124	484.478306	The alligators, they were so tame, and I bet we had about a hundred and fifty, every day we went down to the palmetto patch and whistled and they would come running under the palmetto patch at me and crawl up on my shoulders and talk to me.	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
486.105372	496.177686	Why down there we cut down the palmetto trees to make fence posts and they is the best you ever seen. They would last a hundred years. I know because I tried them twice.	Beatrice Lange	Beatrice Lange
505.036677	625.442772	Surely, but I have to give all that other data.  My name is Zora Neale Hurston and I'm going to sing a gambling song that I collected at Boston Florida. Turpentine is still there. And the men are playing a game called Georgia Skin. That's the most favorite gambling scheme among the workers of the South. And they lose money on the drop of a card, the fall of a card. And there's a rhythm to the fall of the card and after they get set with the two principles and the other people are called pikers and anybody that wants a special card, he pick it out and they call that, uh, picking one in the rough.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
550.645661	556.766529	I think it's better if you explain just how the cards, which way the cards get out or how people are standing there before you go on.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
557.153926	557.153926	Well, you see, they take a deck of cards and they shuffle it real good and watch the man to be sure he don't steal nothing. That is, that he don't set a cub. There are four cards of every kind in the deck. And when the card like the card you have selected falls, you lose. Sometimes if you don't watch the dealer he'll put three cards just like his own down at the bottom of the deck so that everybody falls before he does and then he wins all the money.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
581.792355	581.792355	Well, what does he do? Is the dealer holding the deck of cards?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
584.969008	584.969008	And he puts it on the table. They don't allow him to hold it because they're afraid he'll steal.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
588.30062	588.30062	Alright.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
588.920455	588.920455	So they, he puts it on the table and he turns over a card.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
592.019628	592.019628	He just turns over . . .	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
593.259298	593.259298	Card by card and if the card is just like yours, when it falls, you lose. And, uh, so they holler when he gets all set, when the principles has got their cards and the pikers has got theirs and then the man will say he wants them to put the bets down and he'll say 'Put the money on the wood, and make the bet go good and then again, put it insight and save a fight' and so they all get the bets down and then he start and they'll holler, 'Let the deal go down, boys, let the deal go down'.  And someone will start singing.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
778.12439	819.731405	Uncle Bud is not a work song. It's a sort of social song for amusement and it's so widely distributed, it's growing all the time by incremental repetition, and it is known all over the South. No matter where you go you can find verses of Uncle Bud. And, uh, it's a favorite song. And the men get to working in every kind of work and they just yell down on Uncle Bud and nobody particular leads it. Everybody puts in his verse when he gets ready and Uncle Bud goes and goes and goes.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
808.57438	813.997934	What, is it sung before the respectable ladies?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
813.997934	819.731405	Never! It's one of those jook songs and the woman that they sing Uncle Bud in front of is a jook woman.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
821.43595	823.450413	I thought you heard it from women?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
823.450413	825.271178	Yes, I heard it from women [laughs].	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
825.774793	826.510847	Go ahead.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
954.855372	956.133781	Is there more to it?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
958.070764	961.518595	I know I know some more verses but right off I don't recall.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
965.41894	967.93122	I think that's a very valuable contribution to scientific recording.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
972.133264	972.133264	Alright.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
972.985537	983.057851	Oh the Buford Boat Done Come' is a song from the Geechee country in South Carolina but I heard it down in Florida from a Geechee that moved down in Florida. I forget her name right now.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
983.21281	983.832645	Well, what type of song is it?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
984.142562	984.142562	It's a little dance song with a Charleston rhythm.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
1018.676758	1022.460938	How do they play it? Would you tell us very quickly?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
1022.456095	1026.407541	Uh, it's just a dance song and then they dance a Charleston rhythm on it.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
1026.872417	1028.654442	Was it, is it solo dancing?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
1028.654442	1029.545455	No, group dancing.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
1029.739153	1031.327479	Well, what kind of group is it?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
1031.482438	1034.930269	Oh, just any group, any working group, and they'll clap their hands on it and sing.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
1043.06929	1049.806302	I'm a sing a blues, 'Cuz Ever Been Down', and I got it at Palm Beach from a fellow named from Johnny Bardon.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
1050.852273	1052.518079	Where did you get it	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
1053.021694	1055.84969	I got it in 1933.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
1056.856921	1061.583161	Can you tell me, do you know how old a Blues it is? And how you happened to learn it?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
1061.583161	1074.251033	Well, it's one of those things just go around all the jooks and what not like that and it goes by incremental repetition, a verse here and a verse there. I don't suppose anybody knows how old it is and when it started.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
1189.000852	1194.421488	I heard 'Halimuhfack' down on the East Coast.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
1195.738636	1196.745868	Who did you hear it from and when?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
1197.288223	1197.288223	I don't remember. I was in a big crowd and I learned it in the evening during the crowd. And I'm just, don't can't exactly remember who I, who did teach it to me but I learned it from the crowd most exactly more from one.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
1272.055785	1275.817871	You said you learned it in a crowd. How do you learn most of your songs?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
1276.062012	1303.710938	I learn them. I just get in the crowd with the people if they singing and I listen as best I can and I start to joining in with a phrase or two and then finally I get so I can sing a verse and then I keep on until I learn all the songs, all the verses, and then I sing them back to the people until they tell me that I can sing them just like them and then I take part and I try it out on different people who already know the song until they are quite satisfied that I know it and then I carry it in my memory.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
1303.710938	1307.617188	Well how about those that you have in your books and publish in the journals?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
1307.312012	1313.842773	Well, that's the same way I got them. I learn the song myself and then I can take it with me wherever I go because I -- [cut off]	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
1326.23291	1326.23291	This is a song, uh, called 'Tampa'. I've known it ever since I could remember so I don't know who taught it to me but I heard it sung in my native village when I was a child, not in front of the old folks, of course.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
1388.429752	1390.98657	You say that was uh. . . when was that sung?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
1391.357422	1391.357422	I've known it all my life. No, it was not confined to children. Everybody sung and danced on it. And you hear a Negro orchestra, a local orchestra, they often played it now, played the tune. They don't sing the words but the tune is one of their favorite dance tunes.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
1406.172521	1406.172521	Alright.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
1407.838326	1427.479339	This one. Some of them call it 'Po Boy' and some of them call it 'Po Gal' but it's a pretty well-distributed blues tune all over the South. The words are not rhymed. It's a typical Negro pattern. The same line repeated three times with a sort of flip line on the end and the change is in the tune rather than the words for the most part.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
1428.680269	1430.501033	Where did you pick up the way you sing it?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
1431.547004	1436.621901	I'm - no, not all my life but I kept learning verses as I've gone around.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
26:33:00	26:33:00	How do you want this?	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
1593.052686	1594.757231	Just play it for me in ballad.	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
1595.067923	1621.487603	Mama Don't Want No Peas No Rice' is a song from Nassau in the Bahama islands. They are great song makers and their tunes are decidedly more African than the ones made by the negroes in America. They make songs so rapidly they say 'Anything you do we put you in sing'. And in a few hours they have a song about it. Mama don't want no peas no rice is about a woman who wanted to stay drunk all the time and her husband is really complaining about it. He's explaining to the neighbors what's the matter with his wife and why they don't get along better.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston

1738.028537	29:05:00	Evelyn Werner, 32.	Evelyn Werner	Evelyn Werner
29:05:00	29:05:00	And where were you brought up?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
29:06:00	29:06:00	I was born and raised in Jacksonville, studied voice in Chicago but never went to college.	Evelyn Werner	Evelyn Werner
29:16:00	29:16:00	Uh, huh, What do you mean 'voice'? Singing?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
29:18:00	29:18:00	Yes.	Evelyn Werner	Evelyn Werner
29:19:00	29:19:00	Uh-huh, Alright. But you were brought up, most of your life, you spent right around here?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
29:25:00	29:25:00	Well, as far as the life goes, yes but I'd go to Philadelphia for a while and come back and go to Chicago for a while and come back.	Evelyn Werner	Evelyn Werner
29:34:00	29:54:00	Alright, now you'll tell the story. Apparently the interest in the story is just to have you talk naturally and at the same time, we'll have the story. So, would you try --	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
29:44:00	29:44:00	Man: Go ahead.	Unknown	Unknown
29:45:00	29:45:00	Well, this story was told to me two years ago by one of the heirs to the Reed Plantation, Mulberry Grove, which is just south of Jacksonville. She said that right after the war when the slaves were freed she gave, she told Mariah the cook of her freedom and gave her the house at the end of the field to live in. So Mariah and all of her children set out and the youngest and the tiniest at the end of the line would fall down and get up, fall down again and get up.  So Mrs. Pearson called to Mariah and said, 'You're losing one of your children, Mariah'. And Mariah turned back and said, 'You can have that one, Miss. Pearson, if you wants it.' That's all.	Evelyn Werner	Evelyn Werner
1838.623047	1844.055176	Dr. Corse would you please explain why we asked to have this record made?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
1844.055176	1863.15918	This record was made for the purpose of recording the annunciation of an educated Southern white voice. And the story was one which was recorded by the Federal Writers as part of their work for the American guide series volume that's Florida.	Carita Doggett Corse	Carita Doggett Corse

1873.168945	1874.328613	Dr. Corse will you please introduce the speaker?	Herbert Halpert	Herbert Halpert
1875.427246	1890.930176	This is Mrs. Rolla Southworth, State Director of the Professional Service Projects of the WPA in Florida who will give us her opinion of the recording program of the folk songs in Florida.	Carita Doggett Corse	Carita Doggett Corse
1891.662598	1934.039256	Rolla Southworth: Well, Dr. Corse it would really seem that we have finally grown up as a nation when we can spend the day recording such folklore as we have heard today. And this is only the beginning and in only one city. Think of the endless material alone throughout Florida. Now although we are in the deep South, our state, with Mr. Call, has a very cosmopolitan group. As a matter of fact, the flags of five nations have flown over Florida. Isn't that a fact? And what a wealth of material that will indicate. Personally, my greatest interest is in the Negro Folklore and how justly proud we all are of Zora Hurston whose fine literary ability and wealth of experience has made our recordings possible today.

2029.338843	2051.497934	It's a farm song, made up between the boys plowing on two or more plantations; one would holler 'Hallo' and the other would answer with a second 'Hallo'. That would be a signal for knocking off time for noon, for dinner.	H. W. Stuckey	H. W. Stuckey

2154.196798	2172.172004	Well, it'd be in the afternoon and they usually had one big plantation a well where the boys from the different fields would water their stock. And they would be unhooking from the plowers, the planters, and distributers, and going to water their mules and put them in the lot for the night when they start these hollers.	H. W. Stuckey	H. W.
