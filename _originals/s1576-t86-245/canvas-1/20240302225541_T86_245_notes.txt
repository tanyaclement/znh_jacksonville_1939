1.699535	1.699535	Oh yes, they had the same tune all the time but different wording, you know. They would make up words all the time. You see, the fellows from different railroads would come and work on this track with us and each fellow, perhaps he'd have a new verse that he'd add to the song.	Harold B. Hazelhurst 	Harold B.

Says 'Let's go back boys to double track. The work ain't hard, the man ain't mean. The cook ain't nasty, but the grub ain't clean. You sleep on my good bed and you call 'em bunk. You eat my good ration, and you call it junk. So, now let's go back.'	Harold B. Hazelhurst 	Harold B. Hazelhurst
133.201029	133.201029	How was the arrangement, how was the arrangement of the tents?	Herbert Halpert 	Herbert Halpert
135.962773	135.962773	The tents were in circles. And each, they were built in circles so as when he'd leave the last tent, he would be at the first tent again. He'd go all around and when he stopped at the last tent, he'd be right back at the first tent again.	Harold B. Hazelhurst 	Harold B. Hazelhurst
154.020329	154.020329	Well, he was the foreman of the job?	Herbert Halpert 	Herbert Halpert

203.377648	203.377648	Well, sometime, when the boss man wouldn't go around himself, he'd send some of the fellas, colored fellas, around to arouse the men. They'd say 'Come on boys, let's go back. Yes, you sleep on his good beds and you call 'em bunk,  You eat his good rations, and you call 'em junk. So, now if I have to call it, you want to fight.

247.211479	247.211479	Well, sometimes the fellas, it'd be near pay day, and some of the fellas would think about going away to another job and they began feeling good. They began singing some of these songs and this one, in particular.	Harold B. Hazelhurst 	Harold B. Hazelhurst

371.348324	371.348324	During the early days of the settlers in South Carolina, Buford County, when the church was first established there, before there were schools and seminaries, why the preachers preached mostly by imagination, and as I've been in contact during my boyhood days with quite a few settlers from that part of the state, I've learned this sermon how an old minister use to preach it a long time ago and instead of being able to reiterate from the bible, he just imagined something and went on to preach it in a form of dialect as I shall give you now as near as I can imitate him.	H. W. Stuckey	H. W. Stuckey
576.307483	576.307483	What was that song? When did that song come in?	Herbert Halpert 	Herbert Halpert

727.365428	727.365428	The fire dance is some sort of African survival in the West Indies and they beat the drums and sing these little songs.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston
734.800893	734.800893	And how did you happen to learn it?	Carita Doggett Corse	Carita Doggett Corse
736.535834	736.535834	Well, I was doing research down there, collecting songs out of Columbia University and I collected quite a few of them and this is just one of them.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston

841.977797	841.977797	Are those songs sung in Florida as well as in the West Indies?	Carita Doggett Corse	Carita Doggett Corse
846.332855	846.332855	Yes, Dr. Corse. Uh, they are sung in Key West and Miami and Palm Beach and out in the Everglades where a great number of Nassaus are working in the bean fields and whatnot. Uh, there are a great number of them in Florida who hold jumping dances every week.	Zora Neale Hurston	Zora Neale Hurston

1365.258059	1365.258059	 Thank you, Mr. Pages [distortion].	Herbert Halpert 	Herbert Halpert
1371.00517	1371.00517	Uh, the song that you have just heard Carlos Poz sing, it's sort of a negro song. It is a negro telling his girl not to mix with another, uh, tribe, because he does not consider them as good as they are and does not want to, uh,  mix the tribes. And --	Art Pages	Art Pages
1392.807701	1392.807701	What do you mean by mix the tribes?	Herbert Halpert 	Herbert Halpert
1394.176061	1394.176061	Well, he does that, it seems like the, uh, girl is in love with someone and she, uh, goes to a nearby tribe and he does not want her to continue to go over there and he is asking her to please stay in her, in their grounds.	Art Pages	Art Pages
1408.407001	1408.407001	He doesn't want to have children from the other tribe.	Herbert Halpert 	Herbert Halpert

1610.741785	1610.741785	The idea of the song is uh, the name of the song is 'Merce' and that's a, uh, name, a proper name. It's a negro girl's name and she is supposed to be the most popular of the party and the song refers to her popularity, that is her way of dancing and acting and speaking and so forth and everybody sings to her beauty and her pep, would you say?
